Tools
-----

* [PrmanInstanceArray](https://gitlab.com/JoshuaSenouf/JSKatana/tree/master/src/SuperTools/PrmanInstanceArray)

How to use
------

These tools were written and compiled for Linux, with VSCode as the IDE, CMake as the building tool, a C++11 compiler in mind, and the latest version of Foundry's Katana available.

Download the source, build the project structure using CMake 3.x, open the project using your favorite IDE (tested on VSCode), build the project, execute a "make install" and everything will be installed by default under
```
"${HOME}/workspace/katana/JSKatana" (This can be changed in the main CMakeLists.txt).
```

Dependencies
------

* Katana 2+
* RenderMan 21+
